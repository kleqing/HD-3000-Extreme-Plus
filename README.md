## ‚ùî How about the Extra folder?

### ‚≠ï Explain Tweaks
	* Over Clocking: It is a hack to raise the Voltage of the GPU (A mild raise through official mean)
	 which actually lets it perform quite fast, however I know some do not like to come to over-clocking
	 as myth say they shorten the life cycle of hardware and since this is probably your only PC and that 
	 probably you dont have a cooling pad then is up to you to disable it (Enabled by default).


	* Increase Quality: It will increase the quality of the image (Disabled by default).
